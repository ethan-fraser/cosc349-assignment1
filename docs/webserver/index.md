## Overview
The purpose of the webserver is to provide a frontend interface for users to interact with the platform. It is built with React and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. 

## Running the webserver locally
The webserver can be run locally without running `vagrant up` with this command: `npm run start`. However it will not be connected to the database in dbserver hence there will be no functionality. You may want to run it locally if you want to do basic UI fixes.

## Prototype
Before coding the webserver frontend, a mockup was made on Figma. It is important to note that there are slight variations (eg different colours, different positioning of elements, different sizing etc) in this mockup compared to the final UI because improvements were made as the mockup was being coded. Click [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/dCuyr7IzSFl7IAJ5QDOpDg/349-Assignment-1?node-id=29%3A1382&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=29%3A923&show-proto-sidebar=1) to view the prototype for the UI.
