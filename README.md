## Description üìÉ
Flatbills is a platform for flats to manage their bill payments. There are two types of users - flat managers and flat members.
1. Flat managers - Users who are responsible for managing the flat members' payments of their bill portions.
2. Flat members - Regular users who just pay their bill portions.

This project runs on 3 virtual machines:
1. 192.168.2.11 - This hosts webserver which is a web interface for users to interact with the platform.
2. 192.168.2.12 - This hosts dbserver which is a database that stores all the records of the users.
3. xxx - This hosts the email server which sends email notifications to users on the due date of the bill payments.

While they both use Node.js, the tech stack varies for both webserver and dbserver:
1. webserver - It is a React.js project being served using Express.js. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling. For more information, see [here](./webserver/index.md).
2. dbserver - It runs the MySQL database and the Express.js API that the webserver uses to interface with it. For more information, see [here](./dbserver/index.md).

## Installation and Usage üèÉ

### Requirements
- *VirtualBox (v6.1.x)*\
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- *Vagrant (v2.2.x)*
    - **MacOS**\
    `brew install vagrant`
    - **Linux**\
    Download and install from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads, or install with your distro's package manager.
    - **Windows**\
    Download and install from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.
- *Enable virtualisation on your computer*
    - **MacOS** and **Linux**\
    Should have virtualisation enabled by default
    - **Windows**\
    Does not have virtualisation enabled by default. To enable, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOuTxfzCvMY)

### Running the servers
- *Clone the repository*\
    `git clone https://github.com/ethan-fraser/cosc349-assignment1.git`
- *cd into the resulting directory*\
    `cd cosc349-assignment1`
- *Bring the VMs up*\
    `vagrant up`
- Navigate to http://192.168.2.11:3000/ (192.168.2.11 is the IP address of the webserver and 3000 is React's default port number)

### Restarting the servers
Once you have made changes to the source and you want to update the servers, run the following command:\
`vagrant provision <server_name> --provision-with restart`

### Shutting down the servers
You can shut down all of the servers with the command `vagrant destroy`. If you want to shut down just one of the servers you can specify the name, e.g. `vagrant destroy webserver`. After doing this, the machine's state will be completely lost, and you will need to `vagrant up` the machine again.

## Demo üí°
Covers how to bring up VMs, use flatbills interface, and make changes to source files
