Weight: This assignment is worth 20% of the mark for the paper

### Description
For this assignment, you should design and develop an application whose deployment relies on virtualisation. Your application should operate through coordination of at least **three** different virtual machines (VMs). One of your VMs should be responsible for **data storage** that is important to your application.

However, this assignment is not focused on the functionality of your application: the assignment is focused on how you **build** your application, and in particular how you **facilitate other developers** potentially modifying, (re)building and running your application. Your use of virtualisation should allow a developer to build and run your application even if they check out your projectâ€™s git repository on a different host operating system from yours.
